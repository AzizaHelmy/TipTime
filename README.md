# TipTime
The Tip Time app  allows the user to enter the cost of the service 
and there is a list of RadioButtons lets the user select the tip percentage, and a Switch allows the user to choose whether the tip should be rounded up or not. 
The tip amount is displayed in a TextView, and finally a Calculate Button will tell the app to get the data from the other fields and calculate the tip amount.
